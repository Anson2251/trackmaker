## Notice

### About the online demo

This project is still under development. Many features are being implemented.

This [<u>online demo</u>](https://anson2251.github.io/trackmaker/) (at branch `gh-page-demo`) is for experimental use only. It may not be up to date with the code in this repository.

### About the Bing Maps key

My Bing Maps key exists in the code (`/src/config.ts > bingMapsKey`). If you need to build the page yourself, remember to replace it with your own key. It's free to apply for a basic key from the [Bing Maps Dev Centre](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/).
**DO NOT** use the key provided in the code.
