## Notice

### About the online demo

This project is still under development. Many features are being implemented.

### About the Bing Maps key

My Bing Maps key exists in the code (`/src/config.ts > bingMapsKey`). If you need to build the page yourself, remember to replace it with your own key. It's free to apply for a basic key from the [Bing Maps Dev Centre](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/). I have set up the rules to protect the key, so **DO NOT** use it!
