## Notice

### About the Bing Maps key
My Bing Maps Key exists in the code (`/src/config.ts > bingMapsKey`). If you need to build the page yourself, remember to replace the key with your own key. It's free to apply for a basic key on [Bing Maps Dev Centre](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/). I have setup the rules to protect the key, so **DO NOT** use it!
